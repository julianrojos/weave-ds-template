# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## First rule: modular context, loaded on demand

Pull the right context at the right time — not everything up front. Every piece of this system's
documentation is a **module**: each ADR, each README beside the thing it governs, each
package-level `CLAUDE.md`, each skill. Load a module only when the task actually needs the
decision or detail it holds.

In particular, **do not read all the ADRs at startup** — read the one that governs the surface you
are about to touch, when you are about to touch it.

This is deliberate **progressive disclosure**: it keeps working context lean and lets the system
scale, because the entry map stays small and you descend into a module only when you are in its
territory. This file and every doc it points to is written to be reached that way.

## What this is

A **design-system starter template**. It ships the machinery — token pipeline, component contract
system, prop glossary, Figma wiring, ADR governance, agent skills, CI — and **no components**.

That emptiness is the design, not an unfinished state. Components are built against an accepted
decision; the arc that produces one is:

> **explore → report → decide (ADR) → build**

Exploring the design source and writing up what is there are **done by hand** — Figma is a canvas to
read, not a pipeline stage, and no skill sweeps it. `ds-decide` turns a report's open questions into
a record. The build step is contract-first: `ds-component` authors the specification and invokes a selected
backend emitter into the consumer repository.

```
packages/contracts/ @ds/contracts — THE PRODUCT. Agnostic component contracts + their schema
packages/tokens/   @ds/tokens — DTCG JSON -> CSS custom properties + TS constants
packages/behavior/  @ds/behavior — what Escape means, where an arrow goes. No framework, no DOM
packages/platform-web/ @ds/platform-web — the web platform as data. Every WEB backend reads it
packages/emit-web/ @ds/emit-web — what every DOM-emitting backend shares: contract reading + CSS
packages/react/    @ds/react  — a backend: React bindings, emitter, behaviour primitives
packages/vue/      @ds/vue    — a second backend, same shape. It exists to TEST the contract
packages/angular/  @ds/angular — a third. Attaches to elements rather than rendering them
packages/wc/       @ds/wc     — a fourth, with NO framework: custom elements + a shadow root
apps/react-sandbox/  fast Vite harness at :4300, in the workspace
apps/vue-sandbox/    the same fifteen contracts at :4301
apps/angular-sandbox/ and again at :4302
apps/wc-sandbox/     plain HTML at :4303 — no framework in the page at all
apps/storybook/    complete on disk, deliberately OUT of the install graph
docs/research/     pre-decision: what is measurably true
docs/ADR/          post-decision: what we decided and why
.ai/maps/          the prop glossary — generated, descriptive, gated
.figma/            which design file we read, and what has been reconciled
```

There are FOUR backends on purpose. A contract that compiles to only one framework is not a
specification, it is that framework with extra steps — see
[`docs/research/0004`](./docs/research/0004-a-second-backend-reading-the-same-contracts.md) and
[`0005`](./docs/research/0005-a-third-backend-and-what-only-it-could-find.md) and
[`0006`](./docs/research/0006-the-shadow-boundary.md) for what they proved
and, more usefully, what they did not.

**[`packages/react/CLAUDE.md`](./packages/react/CLAUDE.md) is the authority for library
internals** — component anatomy, the contract system, extraction, the gates. Read it before
authoring or modifying a component. This file covers the monorepo, the token pipeline and
governance.

## Brand it before anything else

On a fresh, unbranded checkout, set the repository identity **once**, before writing components.
Replace `yourname` with your system's name:

```bash
pnpm init-ds yourname --dry    # inspect
pnpm init-ds yourname          # apply, then pnpm install
```

The scope, the token prefix and the data-attribute prefix are one decision in three syntaxes and
must move together — renaming one by hand leaves a repo that builds green and is wrong. `/ds.config.json`
is the single source of truth; never hard-code a prefix anywhere else. The command refuses to
re-brand a repository whose identity has already been initialized.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev                 # React sandbox at :4300
pnpm dev:vue             # Vue sandbox at :4301
pnpm dev:angular         # Angular sandbox at :4302
pnpm dev:wc              # web components at :4303 — the comparison is the point
pnpm build               # tokens, then the library
pnpm verify              # the full local gate — run this before pushing

pnpm contract <Name>     # what IS this component (source + contract, merged, no build)
pnpm contract --coverage # who is contracted
pnpm prop-map            # regenerate the prop glossary
pnpm adr-index           # regenerate the ADR index from the records — never edit it by hand
pnpm verify:docs         # every link, path and command in the docs resolves
pnpm verify:parity       # the four backends have not drifted apart
pnpm report:paints       # token policy vs stylesheet — a REPORT, never a gate
```

`pnpm verify` chains: `format:check → lint → typecheck → verify:contract → prop-map:check →
adr-index:check → verify:docs → verify:figma → verify:parity → build → test`. All of it is green on a fresh clone
with zero components — that is the template's acceptance test.

## Governance lives in the ADRs — consult the one your task touches

[`docs/ADR/`](./docs/ADR/) is the governance layer. Per the first rule, do not read them all up
front; when a task touches a structural decision, open the governing record then.
[`docs/ADR/README.md`](./docs/ADR/README.md) is the index that routes you there.

Two rules make the records durable rather than a maintenance burden:

- **Decision vs contract.** An ADR records the _decision_ and stays agnostic; the schemas, scripts
  and generated files that realize it are its **contracts**, they live with the code they govern,
  and the ADR _links_ them in a `## Contract` table. This is what lets an accepted decision stay
  stable while its implementation moves.
- **Pre-v0 status policy.** Before the first release, records are edited in place and most stay
  **Draft**. Only decisions **already mechanized in code** are Accepted. At v0 the
  supersede-don't-edit discipline switches on.

Working against an accepted ADR without updating it is a defect, not a shortcut.

## The other contracts, and when to read them

| Read it when                                    | File                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Explaining any of this to a designer            | `docs/documentation/` — plain language + diagrams. Explanation, not spec: where it disagrees with a spec, the spec wins. |
| Authoring or changing a component               | `packages/contracts/components/README.md` — **the** authoring contract                                                   |
| Adding or changing a framework backend          | `packages/vue/README.md` — the worked example of what a second backend costs                                             |
| Deciding what is agnostic vs framework-specific | `packages/contracts/schema/README.md` — the two schemas and where the line falls                                         |
| Naming a prop or a value                        | `.ai/maps/prop-map.md` §1–2                                                                                              |
| Writing a token                                 | `packages/tokens/tokens/README.md`                                                                                       |
| Reading the design source                       | `.figma/README.md`                                                                                                       |
| Writing up what you found                       | `docs/research/README.md`                                                                                                |
| Proposing an API for something not yet built    | `.ai/maps/proposals/README.md`                                                                                           |

## Two rules about enforcement

Both are load-bearing, and both were learned the expensive way in the systems this template draws
from:

- **A contract whose breach produces no build error has to be gated in CI, not only in
  `pnpm verify`** — otherwise it is enforced on whichever machine happens to run verify. Equally:
  a build step that throws must reach a non-zero exit, or CI stays green on a failed build.
- **A gate that fails on everything on day one gets switched off, and a switched-off gate protects
  nothing.** Uncontracted components, paint findings and extraction warnings therefore **report**
  rather than fail. Promoting one to a gate is deliberate work, done against a clean baseline.

## Honesty rules for generated and authored artifacts

- **Never hand-edit a generated file.** They carry a do-not-edit banner and a regeneration command.
  `prop-map:check` asserts byte-equality in CI, so an edit is discarded and reddens the build.
- **Generated output must be deterministic.** Fixed code-point comparators, never `localeCompare`;
  sorted directory reads, never filesystem order; nothing machine-specific in any output.
- **A gap is a finding, not a blank to fill.** `code: null`, `separatorUnknown: true`,
  "uncontracted" — these record _not measured yet_, which is more useful than a confident guess,
  because a guess never gets revisited.
- **Never invent a part, a state, an accessibility claim or a token policy to fill a field.** An
  empty field is an honest "not decided". A plausible wrong one passes every check in this repo and
  misleads every reader after you.
