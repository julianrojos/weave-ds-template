# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## First rule: modular context, loaded on demand

Pull the right context at the right time — not everything up front. Every piece of this system's
documentation is a **module**: each ADR, each README beside the thing it governs, each
package-level `CLAUDE.md`, each skill. Load a module only when the task actually needs the
decision or detail it holds.

In particular, **do not read all the ADRs at startup** — read the one that governs the surface you
are about to touch, when you are about to touch it.

This is deliberate **progressive disclosure**: it keeps working context lean and lets the system
scale, because the entry map stays small and you descend into a module only when you are in its
territory. This file and every doc it points to is written to be reached that way.

## What this is

The **Juro design-system instance**. It contains the token pipeline, component contract system, prop
glossary, Figma wiring, ADR governance, agent skills and CI, together with the project decisions and
components built through them. Components are built against an accepted decision; the arc is:

> **explore → report → decide (ADR) → build**

Exploring the design source and writing up what is there are **done by hand** — Figma is a canvas to
read, not a pipeline stage, and no skill sweeps it. `ds-decide` turns a report's open questions into
a record. The build step is mid-migration: the library is moving to contract-driven generation, so
`ds-component` describes a retired flow and carries a banner saying so.

```
packages/contracts/ @juro/contracts — THE PRODUCT. Agnostic component contracts + their schema
packages/tokens/   @juro/tokens — DTCG JSON -> CSS custom properties + TS constants
packages/react/    @juro/react  — one backend: React bindings, emitter, behaviour primitives
apps/sandbox/      fast Vite harness, in the workspace
apps/storybook/    complete on disk, deliberately OUT of the install graph
docs/research/     pre-decision: what is measurably true
docs/ADR/          post-decision: what we decided and why
.ai/maps/          the prop glossary — generated, descriptive, gated
.figma/            which design file we read, and what has been reconciled
```

**[`packages/react/CLAUDE.md`](./packages/react/CLAUDE.md) is the authority for library
internals** — component anatomy, the contract system, extraction, the gates. Read it before
authoring or modifying a component. This file covers the monorepo, the token pipeline and
governance.

## Identity

This repository is already branded (`@juro/*`, `--juro-*`, `data-juro-*`). `/ds.config.json` is the
single source of truth; never hard-code a second prefix. Rebranding is an established-system
migration and has no repository command. See ADR 0011.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev                 # sandbox at :4300
pnpm build               # tokens, then the library
pnpm verify              # the full local gate — run this before pushing

pnpm contract <Name>     # what IS this component (source + contract, merged, no build)
pnpm contract --coverage # who is contracted
pnpm prop-map            # regenerate the prop glossary
pnpm adr-index           # regenerate the ADR index from the records — never edit it by hand
pnpm verify:docs         # every link, path and command in the docs resolves
pnpm report:paints       # token policy vs stylesheet — a REPORT, never a gate
```

`pnpm verify` chains every local gate, then builds and tests. It must be green from a clean checkout
without requiring Figma Desktop or its write bridge.

## Governance lives in the ADRs — consult the one your task touches

[`docs/ADR/`](./docs/ADR/) is the governance layer. Per the first rule, do not read them all up
front; when a task touches a structural decision, open the governing record then.
[`docs/ADR/README.md`](./docs/ADR/README.md) is the index that routes you there.

Two rules make the records durable rather than a maintenance burden:

- **Decision vs contract.** An ADR records the _decision_ and stays agnostic; the schemas, scripts
  and generated files that realize it are its **contracts**, they live with the code they govern,
  and the ADR _links_ them in a `## Contract` table. This is what lets an accepted decision stay
  stable while its implementation moves.
- **Pre-v0 status policy.** Before the first release, records are edited in place and most stay
  **Draft**. Only decisions **already mechanized in code** are Accepted. At v0 the
  supersede-don't-edit discipline switches on.

Working against an accepted ADR without updating it is a defect, not a shortcut.

## The other contracts, and when to read them

| Read it when                                    | File                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Explaining any of this to a designer            | `docs/documentation/` — plain language + diagrams. Explanation, not spec: where it disagrees with a spec, the spec wins. |
| Authoring or changing a component               | `packages/contracts/components/README.md` — **the** authoring contract                                                   |
| Deciding what is agnostic vs framework-specific | `packages/contracts/schema/README.md` — the two schemas and where the line falls                                         |
| Naming a prop or a value                        | `.ai/maps/prop-map.md` §1–2                                                                                              |
| Writing a token                                 | `packages/tokens/tokens/README.md`                                                                                       |
| Reading the design source                       | `.figma/README.md`                                                                                                       |
| Writing up what you found                       | `docs/research/README.md`                                                                                                |
| Proposing an API for something not yet built    | `.ai/maps/proposals/README.md`                                                                                           |

## Two rules about enforcement

Both are load-bearing, and both were learned the expensive way in the systems this template draws
from:

- **A contract whose breach produces no build error has to be gated in CI, not only in
  `pnpm verify`** — otherwise it is enforced on whichever machine happens to run verify. Equally:
  a build step that throws must reach a non-zero exit, or CI stays green on a failed build.
- **A gate that fails on everything on day one gets switched off, and a switched-off gate protects
  nothing.** Uncontracted components, paint findings and extraction warnings therefore **report**
  rather than fail. Promoting one to a gate is deliberate work, done against a clean baseline.

## Honesty rules for generated and authored artifacts

- **Never hand-edit a generated file.** They carry a do-not-edit banner and a regeneration command.
  `prop-map:check` asserts byte-equality in CI, so an edit is discarded and reddens the build.
- **Generated output must be deterministic.** Fixed code-point comparators, never `localeCompare`;
  sorted directory reads, never filesystem order; nothing machine-specific in any output.
- **A gap is a finding, not a blank to fill.** `code: null`, `separatorUnknown: true`,
  "uncontracted" — these record _not measured yet_, which is more useful than a confident guess,
  because a guess never gets revisited.
- **Never invent a part, a state, an accessibility claim or a token policy to fill a field.** An
  empty field is an honest "not decided". A plausible wrong one passes every check in this repo and
  misleads every reader after you.
