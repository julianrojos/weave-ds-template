# `scripts/`

Repo-wide scripts — the ones that operate on the whole repository rather than on one package.

Package-specific machinery lives beside its package:
[`packages/react/scripts/`](../packages/react/scripts/README.md) holds everything that reads or
checks component source.

Every script here is plain Node with no build step, run through a `pnpm` alias. Each one carries a
header comment saying **what it catches that nothing else would** — that is the test for whether it
earns a place in `pnpm verify`.

## What is here

| Script                                   | Command                                   | Kind      | What it is for                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`init-ds.mjs`](./init-ds.mjs)           | `pnpm init-ds <name> [--dry]`             | codemod   | Brand the template **once**: package scope, token prefix and data-attribute prefix together |
| [`verify-docs.mjs`](./verify-docs.mjs)   | `pnpm verify:docs`                        | **gate**  | Every link, path and `pnpm` command named in the docs resolves                              |
| [`adr-index.mjs`](./adr-index.mjs)       | `pnpm adr-index` / `pnpm adr-index:check` | generator | The ADR index, derived from the records themselves                                          |
| [`verify-figma.mjs`](./verify-figma.mjs) | `pnpm verify:figma`                       | **gate**  | `.figma/maps/*.json` validate against their schemas, and claim no code path they lack       |

## The rule these follow

A gate belongs here when its breach **produces no error anywhere else**. A malformed `.figma` map
breaks no build. A link pointing at a deleted file renders fine. A missing ADR row leaves every tool
green. That invisibility is the entire justification — a check for something the compiler already
catches is noise.

The corollary, learned the expensive way: **a gate must run in CI, not only in `pnpm verify`.** A
contract enforced only by `verify` is enforced on whichever machine happens to run it. See
[`.github/workflows/`](../.github/workflows/README.md).

## `init-ds` is different, and runs once

It is a codemod, not a check. It rewrites the package scope (`@juro/*`), the CSS custom-property
prefix (`--juro-*`) and the data-attribute prefix (`data-juro-*`) **together**, because they are one
decision in three syntaxes. Renaming one by hand leaves a repo that builds green and is wrong.

`/ds.config.json` is the source of truth for that identity; `init-ds` rewrites it and every
reference to it. Run `--dry` first. CI runs the whole codemod on a matrix of names and asserts the
renamed repo is still green, so the rename cannot rot.
