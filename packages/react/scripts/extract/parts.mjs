/**
 * Inventory the `data-juro-part` and `data-juro-state` values a component's TSX actually renders.
 *
 * This is what makes the contract's anatomy checkable. A shadow-DOM system gets the same
 * inventory from a generated manifest; here it is a scan of the source, which is both smaller
 * and impossible to serve stale.
 *
 * Deliberately a regex and not an AST walk. It answers one question — "does this literal appear
 * as a part name in this file" — and a scan that is slightly over-permissive is the right
 * failure direction: it can only ever cause the gate to MISS a phantom part, never to reject a
 * part that genuinely renders. An AST walk would have to model conditional JSX, spread props and
 * expression values to do better, and would still be over-permissive at the edges.
 *
 * Known limitation, stated rather than hidden: a computed value
 * (`data-juro-part={isOpen ? 'a' : 'b'}`) is not seen. Do not write one — the whole point of a part
 * name is that it is a stable, findable string.
