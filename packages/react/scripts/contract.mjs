/**
 * `pnpm contract <Name>` — compose one component's merged view.
 *
 * A component's description has an agnostic contract and a framework binding. The contract owns
 * intent, states, axes, anatomy and policy; the React binding owns platform-specific choices. The
 * prop surface is derived from the contract with the same helper used by the emitter.
 *
 * Read them merged when asking what the React backend exposes. Neither authored file is a complete
 * React-facing view on its own.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm contract Button            merged view as JSON
 *   pnpm contract Button --pretty   the same, as a readable summary
 *   pnpm contract --coverage        who is contracted and who is not

 * backend compile?". A contract with no binding is a specification this backend cannot build.
 *
 * Asked the old way, this repo answered "0/0 components contracted. No components exist yet — the
 * intended starting state, not a gap." Confidently wrong: fifteen contracts existed and no script
