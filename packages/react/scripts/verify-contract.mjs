/**
 * `pnpm verify:contract` — the contract gate.
 *
 * Everything it checks is something whose breach produces NO build error and NO failing test: a
 * contract can promise an axis the code does not expose, name a part that never renders, or style
 * a state nothing can enter, and every other tool stays green.
 *
 * WHY PARITY IS THE HEART OF IT — see contracts/README.md.
 * The contract SPECIFIES the axes and their values, because a file that omits them cannot be built
 * from. That duplication is safe only because of what this script does: it asserts the two are
 * equal. Remove these parity checks and the contract silently becomes a stale second opinion —
 * one that still looks authoritative.
 *
 * FAILS
 *   shape      contract or binding does not validate against its schema
 *   identity   name vs directory vs export vs barrel vs binding
 *   parity     contract and implementation disagree about axes, values or defaults
 *   invented   contract names a part / state / slot / axis value the implementation lacks
 *   phantom    contract declares a part the TSX never renders
 *   status     a `deprecated` level whose replacedBy does not exist
 *
 * REPORTS, NEVER FAILS
 *   a component with no contract          (uncontracted is a reportable state, not a failure)
 *   a rendered part the contract omits
 *   extraction warnings
 *
 * That split is not softness: a gate that failed on every uncontracted component on day one would
 * be switched off within the week, and a switched-off gate protects nothing.
