/**
 * `pnpm verify:contract` — the contract gate.
 *
 * Everything it checks is a structural claim whose breach produces no build error by itself: a
 * binding can point at the wrong contract, a member can name an ancestor that does not admit it, or
 * a contract can call a state intrinsic when the selected platform does not provide it.
 *
 * There is deliberately no contract-to-generated-code parity check. Code is emitted from the
 * contract, so comparing the output with its own input is circular. This gate checks the authored
 * graph before emission; regeneration checks belong where generated output is committed.
 *
 * FAILS
 *   shape      contract or binding does not validate against its schema
 *   identity   contract or binding identity disagrees with its directory/name
 *   pointer    a React binding does not resolve to its own contract
 *   member     collection membership is missing or contradictory
 *   reference  a cross-component anatomy reference cannot resolve
 *   invented   a state or dismissal claim cannot be implemented
 *   status     a `deprecated` level whose replacedBy does not exist
 *   conformance a declared behaviour has no shared conformance cases
 *
 * REPORTS, NEVER FAILS
 *   a contract with no React binding
 *   a contract with no changelog
 *
 * That split is not softness: a gate that failed on every uncontracted component on day one would
 * be switched off within the week, and a switched-off gate protects nothing.
