/**
 * What a member registers about itself.
 *
 * ONLY members in the arrow path register. A tab list has two kinds of member — the tab and its
 * panel — and the panel is not a place focus travels to, so it never appears here. That is not a
 * simplification: the two share an identity, and a registry keyed by identity cannot hold both.
 * Which kind a member is is derivable rather than guessed — a member whose root declares
 * `activates` is a thing you choose, and therefore a thing you arrow onto.
 *
 * A member that is merely DISABLED still registers, and reports itself through `disabled`. The two
 * are different questions: one is what kind of member this is, the other is whether this member is
 * available right now. `disabledItems` decides what the second one costs.
