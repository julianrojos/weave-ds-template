/**
 * Closing a region with a key or a press that is not activation.
 *
 * The decision logic is in ./dismissal.ts as pure functions, so the cases in
 * `@juro/contracts/conformance/dismissal.json` execute against it. This hook is the React binding:
 * reading the event, and calling the state writer.
 *
 * NOTE WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, AND WHAT THAT COSTS. There is no document-level listener and no
 * global state. Both handlers go on the region's own root, because both events arrive there: a
 * backdrop click reports the region itself as its target, and Escape bubbles from whatever inside
 * holds focus.
 *
 * That second one is a real limitation rather than a free win, and an earlier version of this
 * comment overstated it. **Escape only reaches this handler when focus is already inside the
 * region.** For a dialog that is always true — it contains focus. For a TOOLTIP it is not: the case
 * the APG actually describes is a tooltip shown on hover with focus somewhere else entirely, and
 * Escape then never arrives here. That case cannot occur while nothing opens a tooltip on hover, so
 * it is accepted rather than solved — but building hover-opening forces this open again, and it is
 * where the first global listener will come from.
 *
 * @param options  the contract's `dismisses` block
 * @param isOpen   whether the region is currently showing
 * @param onDismiss called when it should close

  // because no child is there to receive them. A dialog with 20px of padding closed when someone
  // pressed 20px inside its own corner.

  // a backdrop press. Together they say what was always meant — on the region, and not on it.

  // WHERE THE PRESS BEGAN, which a click alone cannot tell you.

  // A `click` fires on the nearest common ancestor of press and release, with the RELEASE
  // coordinates. So selecting text inside the panel and letting go past its edge produces a click
  // on the region with backdrop coordinates — indistinguishable from a real backdrop press, and it
  // dismissed. Measured, after switching to `click` specifically to avoid this and finding it did
  // not: the drag closed the dialog anyway.
  //
  // Requiring both ends to be on the backdrop is what actually fixes it, and it is why the pointer
  // handler exists purely to remember.

  // NO `defaultPrevented` CHECK, for the reason `useRangeControl` gives at length: on a pointerdown
  // that call is how you suppress text selection and focus, not how you claim an event. Reading it
  // here meant a consumer doing that to their own dialog lost backdrop dismissal with it.
  //
  // The composition it was guarding against does not exist: `range` is the only primitive that
  // preventDefaults a pointerdown, and no contract declares both `range.drag` and a dismissal. If
  // one ever does, the ordering question is real and belongs in the emitter's chain, not in a test
  // here that also catches every consumer who was only suppressing a selection.

  // A press the platform took away — the pointer left the window, a gesture was recognised, a
  // context menu opened — produces no click, so nothing would otherwise clear the flag and it would
  // sit `true` across a close and reopen. Not exploitable today, because a later dismissal still
  // needs a click that independently passes `isBackdrop`; cleared anyway rather than left resting
  // on a second test to cover for it.

  // IN AN EFFECT, not in the render body where this started. Writing a ref during render is
  // against React's rules for a concrete reason: refs are not rolled back when a concurrent render
  // is discarded, so the write escapes a render that never happened. Nothing user-visible followed
  // from it here — the value only ever moves to `false`, and `onClick` re-runs the geometry test
  // before dismissing regardless — but "no failure I could construct" is a weaker guarantee than
  // "not reachable", and this is the only place in the three primitives that broke the rule.
