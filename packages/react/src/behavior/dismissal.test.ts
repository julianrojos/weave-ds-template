// Drives the conformance cases in @juro/contracts against this backend's implementation.
//
// Same arrangement as the other two primitives: the cases are DATA owned by the contracts package,
// and this file is the React adapter for them.
//
// THREE CASES ARE DEFERRED TO A BROWSER, and an earlier version of this file claimed none were.
// That claim was wrong in a way that cost a shipped bug: whether a point falls inside an element's
// box is NOT answerable from plain values, so the mapping from a real event to the word `region`
// was never tested here at all. Every executable case passed while a press on the dialog's own
// padding closed it.
//
// READ "DEFERRED TO A BROWSER" LITERALLY: there is no browser lane in this repo. No jsdom, no
// happy-dom, no Playwright — `vitest` runs in node and these three cases run NOWHERE automated.
// They were verified by HAND, once, on the sandbox Dialog, and that is the same standard
// `apps/sandbox/src/status.ts` holds every verdict to. So a regression in exactly the code that
// fixed the padding bug would not redden anything; it would need someone to press the panel again.
//
// That is a real gap and it is recorded rather than papered over — `CROSS_CUTTING` in status.ts
// carries it too, because `linear-navigation.test.ts` defers five cases on the same terms. Building
// the lane is its own work with its own decision about which runner; skipping straight to it here
// would have been a second unreviewed change in a file that just had a bug.
//
// The deferred cases are listed below with a reason each, following the pattern
// `linear-navigation.test.ts` established, so the gap between "tested here" and "verified
// somewhere" stays visible instead of looking like completeness.
