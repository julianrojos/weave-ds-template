// and docs/research/0002 reports it.

// handler and `aria-checked` on every component it touched, which produced a Field that referenced
// an undeclared variable and put `type="button"` on a div. What follows is the same probe with
// those assumptions moved out of the templates and into either the binding, the contract, or a
// logged assumption. It is still not the emitter.
