# `@juro/contracts`

**The product.** A component contract is the agnostic specification a component is _generated from_ —
not a description of one that already exists.

Nothing framework-shaped may enter this package. No element names, no hooks, no refs, no `className`,
no import syntax. The test is one question, inherited from the directory this package replaced:

> **If it would still be true in React Native, it belongs here.**

Nothing with a token value or a colour may enter either. This library is **unstyled**: a contract
names the visual channels a part paints and leaves the source unbound, so a consumer wires their own
token system into it. See [`components/README.md`](./components/README.md) §3.

## What is here

| Path                             | Holds                                                                        | State     |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| [`schema/`](./schema/)           | the schemas a contract is validated against                                  | **built** |
| [`components/`](./components/)   | one directory per contract, each with its own changelog                      | **built** |
| [`conformance/`](./conformance/) | framework-neutral behaviour cases, as data                                   | **built** |
| `prop-canon.json`                | the agnostic vocabulary: axis names, canonical values, anti-synonym glossary | **built** |

`components/` shipped empty by design, the same way `packages/react` ships with no components: a
contract is written against evidence and an accepted decision, never scaffolded in advance. It now
holds fifteen, written on `spike/compile-switch` to find out what a contract must be able to say
before it can be compiled at all.

## How this relates to its neighbours

```
@juro/contracts          the specification.        Agnostic. Versioned. The thing that ships.
   |
   v
packages/react/        one backend. Holds the React binding per contract, the emitter,
                       and the behaviour primitives emitted code imports.
   |
   v
consumer's repo        generated component source. Theirs to own, theirs to style.

@juro/tokens             a REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION of wiring tokens to a contract's unbound
                       channels. One worked example, not a dependency of anything here.
```

A second framework is a new `packages/<framework>/` holding its own bindings, emitter and
prop-binding table. **Nothing in this package changes when one is added** — that is the whole point
of the split, and the only real test of whether it worked.

## Not built yet

This package is currently the schemas and the vocabulary. Stated plainly because a document that
describes an intention in the present tense is how a repo starts lying about itself:

- **No loader.** There is no `.` export and no `toIR()`. `pnpm verify:contract` reads the schema by
  path, not by package specifier.
- **No `layout` block.** The unstyled policy needs one — structural CSS that a contract's stated
  behaviour depends on is not decoration and cannot be left to a consumer. Nothing has measured what
  it must hold; the three patterns drafted so far barely exercised it.
- **No behaviour vocabulary.** The interaction schema that would carry one does not exist.
- **No form participation.** `name`, `value` and `required` are not states, not behaviour and not
  styling, and nothing currently planned holds them.
- **No way to state a relationship between parts,** which is most of what a Field does, or to
  declare a value the consumer must supply and the component cannot default — an accordion's heading
  level being the worked example. Both are prose today, where no gate can reach them.

**There is deliberately no `props` block, and there will not be one.** A prop name is a framework's
spelling of a fact, not the fact. `checked` + `defaultChecked` + `onCheckedChange` is React's
rendering of _this state can be set from outside and the user can change it_; Vue spells the same
fact `modelValue` + `update:modelValue`. The contract states the rule — see `states.*.control` — and
each framework's `prop-bindings.json` compiles it into that framework's vocabulary. See
[ADR 0004](../../docs/ADR/0004-a-state-declares-who-may-set-it-and-props-are-generated-from-that.md).

Those gaps are earned by evidence rather than designed in advance. The first pass is
`docs/research/0001-contract-schema-smoke-test.md`, which drafted four contracts against real
reference APIs and reported where the schema fell short; ADRs 0003 and 0004 record what it settled.
