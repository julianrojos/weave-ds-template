# @ds/tokens

DTCG JSON in, CSS custom properties and TypeScript constants out.

This package supports the starter's empty state, but the current repo now contains the token set
measured from Figma on **2026-09-10**: 154 DTCG source tokens across six collections. If the source
directory is empty in a fresh template, the build emits an empty `:root {}` and says so. ADR 0005
records why this first source import preserves the measured Figma names even where they are not
final token policy.

## Where things are documented

Each fact lives in exactly one authoritative place. Go there rather than trusting a restatement.

| How to name a token, and the tier it belongs to          | [`tokens/README.md`](./tokens/README.md)                                                                                        |

| How tokens become pixels in a component                  | `packages/contracts/components/README.md` §4                                                                                    |

| The custom-property prefix                               | `/ds.config.json` — never hard-code it                                                                                          |

## Commands

```bash
pnpm build:tokens     # DTCG JSON -> build/css/variables.css + build/ts/index.{js,d.ts}
pnpm tokens:watch     # same, in watch mode, while editing token JSON
```

## Outputs

| File                               | What it is                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `build/css/variables.css`          | Every token as a CSS custom property on `:root`. **This is the file a consumer imports.** |
| `build/ts/index.js` + `index.d.ts` | The same tokens as a typed constant map, for the cases where JS needs a token name.       |

Everything under `build/` is **generated and gitignored**. Never hand-edit it; edit the JSON and
rebuild. A generated file that someone has edited is worse than no generated file, because the
next build silently discards the edit.

## Consuming it

```ts
import '@ds/tokens/css'; // once, at the app root — @ds/react's barrel already does this
```

The prefix comes from `/ds.config.json`, so after `pnpm init-ds weave` the properties are
`--weave-*` and this package is `@weave/tokens`.
