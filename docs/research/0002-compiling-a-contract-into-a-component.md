# Compiling contracts into components — the emitter spike

- **Date:** 2026-09-01
- **Source:** the four contracts in `packages/contracts/components/` — `Switch`, `Field`,
  `Accordion`, `AccordionItem` — with their bindings in `packages/react/bindings/`, compiled by
  `packages/react/src/emit/emit.mjs` (a throwaway probe, not the emitter). Output rendered in
  `apps/sandbox` and driven in Chrome.
- **Method:** Wrote the smallest emitter that could produce a working React Switch, ran it, wired the
  result into the sandbox, and exercised it in a browser. Then pointed the same emitter at the other
  three contracts to find out what it had silently assumed. Accessibility was checked by reading the
  browser's accessibility tree rather than by inspecting markup — which turned out to matter.

  The emitter records every decision it had to make that the contract could not supply, in an
  `EMITTER_ASSUMPTIONS` list it prints on each run. **That list is the actual finding**; the working
  components are only evidence that the list is complete enough to compile.

  **Not covered:** one framework, one backend author, four contracts. No second framework, which is
  the case most likely to break the rules in ADR 0004. No test suite — correctness was established by
  driving the page. Regeneration was run repeatedly but never against a consumer who had edited the
  emitted files. The emitted components are not covered by `pnpm typecheck`, which reaches only
  `packages/react`; they were typechecked by invoking `tsc` directly, and nothing in CI does that.

## What is there (measured)

### A contract compiled into a working component

`node packages/react/src/emit/emit.mjs Switch --out apps/sandbox/src/components` produced four
files. Three are regenerated on every run; `Switch.theme.css` is written once and then left alone.

The sandbox renders it, and it behaves:

| Exercise                                 | Result                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Uncontrolled switch, clicked             | toggled on; thumb travelled; component owned its own state   |
| Controlled switch, toggled from the page | flipped, and the page's own label updated — callback fired   |
| `disabled`, clicked                      | did not toggle                                               |
| `readOnly`, clicked                      | did not toggle                                               |
| Browser accessibility tree               | seven nodes, each `switch` with its label as accessible name |

Console was clean; the only exception came from a browser extension.

### The prop surface was generated, not written

`states` produced exactly what ADR 0004's `controlRules` specify, with no per-component mapping:

| State in contract | `control`  | Props emitted                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `checked`         | `shared`   | `checked`, `defaultChecked`, `onCheckedChange` |
| `disabled`        | `consumer` | `disabled`                                     |
| `read-only`       | `consumer` | `readOnly`                                     |
| `hover`           | `internal` | — none —                                       |
| `focus-visible`   | `internal` | — none —                                       |

The controlled/uncontrolled machinery — `const controlled = checked !== undefined`, the internal
`useState` seeded from `defaultChecked`, the callback firing either way — was generated from the
single word `shared`.

### The emitter had to decide three things the contract does not state

It printed these itself:

**1. How a state reaches the DOM.** The contract says `checked` exists and who may set it. It never
says whether that becomes `aria-checked`, a `data-juro-state`, or a native attribute. The emitter chose
ARIA where one exists, the native attribute for `disabled`, and `data-<prefix>-state` otherwise.

**2. Structural CSS.** Nothing in the contract states that the thumb must be out of flow. The
emitter hardcodes `position: absolute` on every non-root part.

**3. A scoping selector.** With no CSS Modules there is no hashing, so `[data-juro-part='root']` would
match every component on a page. The emitter invented `data-juro-component="Switch"` on the root.

### The theme file is a complete list of sockets

`Switch.theme.css` was emitted with 18 commented channels across two parts and four states, each
grouped under a selector the emitter derived. Filling it took one pass with no reference to any other
file — and one line had to be added that the contract never named: `inset-inline-start` on the thumb,
which is positioning rather than paint.

### Regeneration preserves the consumer's file, and is not byte-stable

Re-running the emitter over its own output:

| File                   | Result                                                    |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Switch.theme.css`     | **kept** — reported as `kept (yours — never regenerated)` |
| `Switch.structure.css` | byte-identical                                            |
| `Switch.tsx`           | **differs**                                               |

The cause is not the emitter being non-deterministic. It emits this:

```tsx
export interface SwitchProps
  extends Omit<ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>, 'checked' | 'defaultChecked' | ...> {
```

and Prettier reflows it to this:

```tsx
export interface SwitchProps extends Omit<
  ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>,
  'checked' | 'defaultChecked' | ...
> {
```

So `emit → format` and `format → emit` produce different bytes, indefinitely.

### One check ran here that runs nowhere else

The emitter resolves `binding.contract` and fails if it does not point at the contract it just read.
`verify:contract` does not do this — the gap ADR 0002 named as a way this could fail quietly.

### The other three contracts did not compile equally

Pointing the same emitter at `Field`, `Accordion` and `AccordionItem`:

| Contract        | Verdict     | What compiled                         | What did not                                                        |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Switch`        | **works**   | everything                            | —                                                                   |
| `Field`         | **partial** | anatomy, and 4 slots as content props | all 3 of its `shared` states; every ARIA relationship               |
| `Accordion`     | **shell**   | a wrapper and `disabled`              | the open set — no `value`, no `onValueChange`, no `multiple`        |
| `AccordionItem` | **shell**   | anatomy, 2 slots, `disabled`          | its identity, its open state, and its role landed on the wrong node |

**The first emitter was Switch-shaped, and the other contracts proved it.** v1 hardcoded
`ButtonHTMLAttributes`, `type="button"`, `aria-checked` and a click-to-toggle handler into every
component it touched. Run against `Field` it produced a `<div>` carrying `type="button"` and
`aria-checked`, referencing an undeclared `readOnly` variable. Those were emitter bugs, not contract
gaps, and v2 moved each one out of the template — element type now comes from the binding, and
activation is wired only for roles that are self-toggling.

**TypeScript then found a gap the emitter had not logged.** With the assumptions removed, `Field`
emitted three state setters that nothing calls:

```
Field.tsx(47,27): error TS6133: 'setInvalidInternal' is declared but its value is never read.
Field.tsx(50,27): error TS6133: 'setTouchedInternal' is declared but its value is never read.
Field.tsx(53,25): error TS6133: 'setDirtyInternal' is declared but its value is never read.
```

`invalid`, `touched` and `dirty` are all `control: shared`, so a consumer may set them — but nothing
in the contract says what _changes_ them. The emitter now emits the setter with a comment saying so,
because the developer reading the file is the person who needs to know.

### Field renders correctly and does not work

The most consequential result, and it is invisible in a screenshot. Reading the accessibility tree
of the rendered `Field`:

```
generic "Email address"                            <- the label, not a label
generic "We only use this to send receipts."       <- the description, unassociated
generic "That does not look like an email address." <- the error, unannounced
textbox "you@example.com"                          <- named by its PLACEHOLDER
```

Every part rendered. Nothing was wired. The control's accessible name is its placeholder, the error
is not announced when it appears, and `aria-invalid` is absent — because the relationships between
those parts exist only as prose in `intent.behaviour`. `Field` exists to do exactly one job, and the
generated component does not do it while looking complete.

### A component's role landed on the wrong node

`AccordionItem` declares `semantics.role: "button"`, and its binding says in prose:

> The contract's `semantics.role` of `button` lands on the `trigger` part, not on the rendered root.

The emitter put it on the root. The accessibility tree confirms the result: the whole item —
heading _and_ panel together — is announced as one button. Nothing in either schema has a field for
which node a role belongs to, so the binding could only say it in a note.

### Slot names and part names do not have to match, and nothing reconciles them

`Field` declares slots `label`, `control`, `description`, `error`; its anatomy names parts `label`,
`description`, `error`. `control` has no part, so the emitter rendered it bare, after the parts —
putting the input _below its own error message_. `AccordionItem` has the same mismatch between its
`heading` slot and its `header` part.

### Guessing structure from prose failed silently

Between v1 and v2 the emitter stopped hardcoding layout and tried to infer it, by matching
`/out of flow|position/i` against each state's `visual` prose. `Switch`'s prose says _"The thumb sits
at the end of the track"_ — no match — so it emitted `display: block` and no positioning. **The thumb
collapsed onto the track**, silently, and the contract's stated promise about position carrying the
state became false.

v3 therefore emits no layout at all and says so in the file. `Switch`'s real layout now lives in the
consumer's `theme.css` under a banner explaining that it is in the wrong place.

### A second pass: the accordion now works, and what it took

The contract gained two blocks and the anatomy gained five per-part fields. All are marked
EXPERIMENTAL in the schema and none is yet recorded in an ADR.

| Addition                               | Where                                | What it fixed                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `collection`                           | Accordion                            | the parent holds a selection of member identities — the fact that existed only as prose   |
| `member`                               | AccordionItem                        | how a child learns whether it is in that selection                                        |
| `role` on a part                       | AccordionItem                        | the role landing on the root and announcing the whole section as one button               |
| `activates`                            | AccordionItem's trigger              | what causes the state to change; also retires the emitter's hardcoded `TOGGLE_ROLES` list |
| `controls` / `namedBy` / `describedBy` | AccordionItem, Field                 | the ARIA wiring that made the generated Field inert                                       |
| `visibleWhen`                          | AccordionItem's panel, Field's error | "the panel is revealed", which had been prose in `visual`                                 |
| `part` on a slot                       | AccordionItem, Field                 | slot content landing outside any described region                                         |

`cardinality` takes three values rather than Base UI's `multiple: boolean`, because `one` (a tab
list, which can never show nothing) and `at-most-one` (a single-open accordion, which may close its
last section) are different and a boolean cannot hold the difference.

The emitter now generates, from those declarations alone: a React context on the parent, the
controlled/uncontrolled selection with its toggle, the member's comparison against it, the
`aria-expanded` / `aria-controls` / `aria-labelledby` triangle with generated ids, the `hidden`
panel, and cascading `disabled`. All four contracts typecheck under `--strict --noUnusedLocals`.

### A member contract is not self-contained

Compiling `AccordionItem` requires knowing whether the selection is a set or a single value, and
that fact lives on `Accordion`. The emitter has to open the ancestor's contract to compile the
child's. It now also checks that `AccordionItem.member.of` and `Accordion.collection.items` agree
and fails if they do not — and it is the only thing that checks.

### Retiring the hardcoded toggle silently broke the Switch

Replacing `TOGGLE_ROLES` with the declared `activates` field was the right move and shipped with a
defect: `Switch`'s contract was never given the declaration that replaced its special case. The
generated component still rendered, still typechecked, and still worked when driven from the page —
it simply could not be clicked. Found by using it.

The emitted file said so, in the comment the emitter writes when a shared state has no declared
cause:

```
// Nothing in the contract says what CHANGES `checked`: no part declares
// `activates`. It works when controlled from outside; uncontrolled it cannot move.
void setCheckedInternal;
```

That comment described the symptom exactly, and nothing read it. **A generated artifact explaining
its own defect in a comment is not a gate.** The regeneration check that ADR 0002 anticipated would
not have caught this either: the output was internally consistent and byte-stable.

The same regeneration surfaced a second defect, found by reading rather than clicking:
`aria-checked` was emitted as `{value || undefined}`, so an OFF switch carried no `aria-checked` at
all and was announced as having no on/off state. The APG requires `aria-checked="false"`. Every
boolean ARIA attribute had been treated as omissible-when-false, which is right for
`aria-readonly` and wrong for `aria-checked`, and nothing in the contract distinguishes the two.

### The accordion resized as it opened, and nothing could have said not to

Found by using the component, not by reading it. With no definite width, an accordion is as wide as
its widest heading when collapsed and as wide as its widest panel when expanded, so every section
shifts under the pointer as you open one.

_Opening a section must not change the component's width_ is exactly the kind of promise a contract
should carry — the masterclass Tabs contract makes the equivalent promise about height, in prose.
There is nowhere to put it. It ended up in the consumer's theme file, where nothing checks it and a
consumer who omits it gets a component that works and jumps.

Worth noting alongside: the Accordion contract lists `display` and `gap` among its root's **paint**
channels. Neither is paint. The paint/layout line is drawn in the documentation and not in the
schema, so a contract author can put structure in `paints` and every gate stays green.

### A third pass: RadioGroup and Tooltip, chosen to break things

| Contract                   | Verdict     | What broke                                                |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RadioGroup` / `RadioItem` | **partial** | the entire keyboard model                                 |
| `Tooltip`                  | **shell**   | what opens it, when, what dismisses it, and where it goes |

**`cardinality: one` worked on first use.** Clicking the chosen radio does nothing, where clicking
an open accordion section closes it — the same `activates: { toggles: "member" }` declaration
produced both behaviours, because the emitter reads cardinality from the ancestor. The field name is
now wrong for radios (nothing toggles), which is cosmetic and worth fixing.

**Three emitter bugs, each found by a different means:**

- **A radio with no `aria-checked`.** The state a member reflects is `control: internal`, so it
  produces no prop — and the state-to-attribute loop walked props. The radio carried `role="radio"`
  and no checked state at all. Found by reading the output.
- **`aria-expanded` on a tooltip wrapper.** The state-to-attribute table is keyed by state NAME, and
  `open` means `aria-expanded` on an accordion trigger and nothing on a tooltip root. The right
  attribute depends on the **role**, which the state name does not carry. Now gated on the element
  having a role, which is a heuristic, not a fix.
- **`semantics.focusable` was declared by two contracts and read by nothing.** Radio items were
  unreachable by keyboard entirely.

### The keyboard model is the sharpest gap yet

`RadioGroup`'s APG pattern is normative and complete, and requires: arrow keys that move focus **and
change the selection**; wrapping at both ends; a roving tabindex with exactly one option in the Tab
sequence, entering on the chosen one; disabled options skipped.

`intent.behaviour` states every one of those in prose. The contract can express none of them. The
generated group therefore puts every option in the Tab order and ignores the arrow keys — it
contradicts its own contract, in the one component where the normative source left no room for
interpretation.

The accordion did not expose this, because the APG had _removed_ roving focus from that pattern and
plain buttons were enough. That was luck.

### The authority order broke on Tooltip

The APG's tooltip pattern is explicitly _"work in progress; it does not yet have task force
consensus"_, and **does not specify what shows a tooltip** — only that Escape dismisses one. The
normative layer, which the whole sourcing order rests on, has a hole exactly where the hard part is.

Base UI fills it with eight parts and roughly twenty positioning props — `Provider`, `Root`,
`Trigger`, `Portal`, `Positioner`, `Popup`, `Arrow`, `Viewport`; `side`, `sideOffset`, `align`,
`alignOffset`, `collisionAvoidance`, `collisionBoundary`, `collisionPadding`, `sticky`,
`positionMethod`, plus CSS variables for anchor and available size. The contract expressed a
`placement` axis, and nothing reads it.

### A fourth pass: Button, and two limbs with no pulse

`Button` was chosen last on purpose — the simplest component in any library, and the first to use
`axes` and `whenAxis`. Both had been in the schema since before this branch.

**Neither had ever been read by anything.** Emitting `Button` against three declared axes produced:

```
props: disabled, loading, iconStart, iconEnd
```

No `hierarchy`, no `variant`, no `size`. Three axes, zero props — and the emitter did not log an
assumption about it, because it did not know axes existed. `whenAxis` likewise compiled to nothing.
A contract could declare a full variant surface, validate, generate, and produce a component with no
variants at all.

Three changes made them live:

| Change             | Effect                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `axes` → props     | a typed union per axis, with the declared default applied in destructuring    |
| axis value → DOM   | `data-<prefix>-<axis>="<value>"` on the root                                  |
| `whenAxis` → theme | one commented socket block per axis value, generated rather than hand-written |

The DOM attribute is a **third attribute family** beside `part` and `state`, invented by the emitter
because an unstyled library has no class to hang a variant on. Nothing in the contract system
defines it.

Also fixed: `composition.children` may now name a `part`, so `Button`'s children render inside its
`label` region rather than after its trailing icon. And a `<button>` no longer emits a redundant
`role="button"`.

Verified in the page: twelve buttons, defaults applied where props were omitted, `hierarchy` crossed
with `variant` producing the primary-destructive and secondary-destructive pair the two axes exist
to express, three distinct sizes, and the `loading` spinner animating in the leading icon's slot
without moving the label.

### A fifth pass: Checkbox, and the state model's first real widening

Every state in this schema was a boolean until a checkbox needed three conditions. Written the way
it should be — one state with three values — the contract was rejected four times:

```
/states/checked                       additionalProperties  (values)
/states/checked                       additionalProperties  (default)
/anatomy/.../tick/visibleWhen         pattern  "checked=checked"
/anatomy/.../dash/visibleWhen         pattern  "checked=mixed"
```

**Two booleans cannot express it.** `checked` plus `indeterminate` as separate flags admits
`checked: true, indeterminate: true`, which is meaningless, and no gate here could reject it. One
state with three values makes the illegal combination unrepresentable.

Schema v5 adds `states.*.values` and `states.*.default` (omit them and a state is still a boolean),
widens `visibleWhen` to take `state=value`, and adds `activates.between` — the two values a **user**
may move between. That last one is not ceremony: without it the emitter cycles through all three and
offers `mixed` as a click target, which is a real defect in real libraries.

Verified in the page: `mixed → checked → unchecked → checked`, the dash and the tick swapping as
different shapes, `aria-checked` reporting `mixed` rather than `false`, and the disabled one
refusing.

**Two emitter bugs, both worth naming:**

- **`hidden={!checkedValue === 'checked'}`.** Negating a comparison without parentheses parses as
  `(!checkedValue) === 'checked'`, which is always false. The generated component typechecked and
  rendered; the mark simply never appeared. Templating produced an expression no human wrote.
- **`mixed` resolved to `unchecked`.** The fallback compared against the wrong end of the pair.
  Correct is: anything outside the pair falls to the _second_ value. The contract and the APG both
  say a mixed checkbox becomes checked; the first implementation made it become unchecked, and it
  looked entirely plausible.

### A sixth pass: TextField and Slider, and the third and fourth value shapes

Both were rejected identically, on the same field:

```
TextField  /states/value  additionalProperties   (valueType)
Slider     /states/value  additionalProperties   (valueType, min, max, step)
```

A state could be a boolean, or — since `Checkbox` — one of a listed set. Neither can hold free text,
and neither can hold a number with bounds. **The two most common controls in any library were
inexpressible.** Schema v6 adds `valueType: "string" | "number"` with `min`, `max` and `step`.

`TextField` then compiled and works. But note _why_ typing works: nothing in the contract says it
does. The binding renders a native `<input>`, and the emitter knows an input edits its own value.

`Slider` compiled to a shell, and it is the most instructive result in this pass:

| What a slider is                      | Where it lives                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| a number between bounds, in steps     | **the contract** — `valueType`, `min`, `max`, `step` |
| `aria-valuemin` / `max` / `now`       | **generated** from those                             |
| arrow keys, Page Up/Down, Home/End    | nowhere                                              |
| pointer drag                          | nowhere                                              |
| the fill's length, the thumb's offset | nowhere — and not expressible as CSS either          |

**Slider's keyboard is a different gap from RadioGroup's.** RadioGroup navigates _between items_;
Slider _steps a number_. One navigation primitive will not cover both, which is worth knowing before
designing one.

**And the fill's position is a gap of a shape not seen before.** It is neither a declaration nor a
constraint: it is _arithmetic over a state_. `inline-size` is the value as a percentage. No `layout`
block of CSS-shaped rules could express it, however it were designed. The sandbox works around it by
handing the number back in as a custom property and doing the maths in the consumer's theme file —
which means the one thing that makes a slider a slider is the consumer's to implement.

**Four emitter bugs, all the same root cause:** the emitter did not know enough about HTML.
`role="textbox"` restated on an `<input>`; `tabIndex` added to a natively focusable element;
`aria-disabled` used where the native `disabled` attribute exists; and — the one that matters —
**whatever the person typed mirrored into `data-juro-state-value`**. A boolean or enumerated state is
a styling hook; free text is content, and copying it into an attribute leaks it into the DOM.

Also in this pass: `Field` now composes a generated `TextField` rather than a raw input — the first
contract whose slot is filled by another contract's output.

### A seventh pass: Dialog and the Tabs family — fifteen contracts

**`collection.items` had to become a list.** A tab and its panel both compare against the same
selection, so both are members — and `items` named exactly one component. The emitter refused to
compile `TabPanel` with a clear message rather than producing something wrong, which is the
cross-contract check earning its place:

```
TabPanel says it is a member of Tabs, but Tabs.collection.items admits TabItem
```

**Tabs confirmed the navigation gap is one gap, not two.** Its keyboard requirement is identical to
`RadioGroup`'s — arrows that move and select, wrapping, one Tab stop. One primitive would serve
both. `Slider` remains the odd one out: stepping a number is a different problem.

**A new gap: references cannot cross a component boundary.** A tab must point at its panel with
`aria-controls`, and the panel must be named by its tab with `aria-labelledby`. Both `controls` and
`namedBy` can only name a _sibling part within the same component_. Neither reference is generated,
so the generated panel is announced unnamed. This is the same shape as `Field`'s original problem,
one level up.

**`Dialog` is a styled box that appears and disappears.** Four behaviours are stated in the contract
and none is expressible: focus containment, focus movement and return, an inert background, and
Escape. Tabbing out of the open dialog and into the page behind it is demonstrable in the sandbox.

Worth naming precisely: a native `<dialog>` with `showModal()` supplies three of those four for
free. The binding rejected it because it cannot be portalled into an arbitrary container and brings
a top-layer stacking model the unstyled approach cannot reason about. **Three of the four gaps are
gaps only because of that trade**, which is a much narrower and more answerable question than
"how do we express modality".

**Two more emitter bugs of the now-familiar kind:**

- **Every tab shipped with no `aria-selected`.** The state-to-ARIA table had no `selected` entry,
  and the member branch was an `if` with no `else` — an unlisted state name emitted nothing at all.
  Exactly the radio's missing `aria-checked`, three passes later, in a different code path.
- **`visibleWhen` on a ROOT was never applied**, only on child parts. `TabPanel` and `Dialog` both
  rendered permanently visible until it was fixed.

## What it appears to mean (inferred)

Every item below is a reading, not a measurement.

**The central claim of ADR 0004 survived its first contact with a compiler.** One word in a contract
generated three correctly-wired props, and `internal` correctly generated nothing. That is one
component in one framework, so it is evidence rather than proof — but it is the first evidence of any
kind that a contract can be compiled rather than only read.

**The three assumptions look like one problem wearing three hats: the contract describes a
component's meaning but not its realisation.** Which attribute carries a state, where a part sits,
how a component is scoped — each is a decision a second backend must also make, with nothing to guide
it toward the same answer. Two backends would produce components that satisfy the same contract and
disagree about the DOM, which would surface as consumers' CSS working in React and not in Vue.

**The `layout` gap now looks larger than a missing block.** It is not only that structural CSS has
nowhere to be declared — the emitter had to _invent_ the structure, meaning the layout on which the
contract's stated promise depends is currently a property of the emitter, per component, unreviewable
and ungated. The `inset-inline-start` line that ended up in the consumer's theme file is the same
problem leaking one layer further out.

**`data-juro-component` looks like a real gap in the anatomy convention, not just this spike's
shortcut.** The repo documents `data-<prefix>-part` and `data-<prefix>-state` and stops there. Any
unstyled library that abandons CSS Modules needs a component-level handle, and inventing one per
backend would break the promise that part attributes are a stable styling surface.

**The four contracts appear to fall into three kinds, and only one kind compiles today.** A
component whose behaviour the platform already provides (`Switch`) compiles completely. One whose job
is wiring relationships between its own parts (`Field`) compiles its shape and none of its purpose.
One whose central fact is a shared piece of state across children (`Accordion`) compiles to an inert
wrapper. If that reading holds, the missing pieces are not a list of fields — they are one missing
layer, and `Switch` only worked because the browser supplied that layer for free.

**`Field` looks like the strongest argument yet that relationships need a home in the schema.** It is
not that the generated component is unfinished; it is that it is _finished-looking and inert_, which
is the failure mode this repo repeatedly says it fears. A reviewer glancing at the sandbox sees a
label, a description, an error and an input, and has no way to notice that none of them know about
each other.

**Role-on-a-part looks like a small schema change with a large blast radius.** `semantics.role`
currently implies "the root", and for `AccordionItem` that is wrong in a way that produces a real
accessibility defect. Whether the fix belongs in the contract (a role per anatomy part) or in the
binding (a `roleTarget`, alongside the existing `refTarget` and `classNamePassthrough`) turns on
whether "which region carries the meaning" is a framework question. It does not appear to be one.

**The slot/part mismatch suggests slots and anatomy are describing the same thing twice.** A slot is
where content goes; a part is a named region. `Field`'s `label` slot and `label` part are the same
place, and the emitter reconciled them by name — which worked by luck, and failed for `control` and
for `heading`/`header`.

**The accordion result suggests the missing layer is smaller than it looked.** Two blocks and five
part-level fields took `Accordion` from inert to working, and the same fields fixed `Field`'s ARIA.
That is a vocabulary, not a language — each field takes one name and no expression — which is the
shape ADR 0004 argued for on different evidence.

**`layout` now looks like it needs constraints, not just declarations.** The width defect is not
"the root has `display: flex`"; it is "the root's size must not depend on which parts are visible".
That is a rule about permissible layouts rather than a layout. If that reading is right, a `layout`
block that only lists CSS-shaped declarations will not be able to express the thing that actually
broke.

**The gaps now sort into three kinds, and they are not equally hard.** One is solved: a parent
holding a selection across children, closed by `collection` and `member`. One is named but unbuilt:
the behaviour vocabulary, of which `RadioGroup`'s keyboard model is the clearest instance. One is not
even named: positioning, where `Tooltip` needs an anchor, a side, collision handling and a layer, and
`layout` does not exist.

**Positioning may not belong in this schema at all.** Base UI spends eight parts and twenty props on
it, most of which describe _how to compute a position_ rather than what the component means. A
contract that absorbed that would stop being a specification and become a layout engine's
configuration file. The alternative — declaring only the intent, `placement: top`, and leaving the
computation to each backend — is what the current contract does, and it produced a tooltip that
cannot flip and is clipped by any scrolling ancestor. Neither answer is obviously right.

**`aria-expanded` on the tooltip suggests the state-to-DOM mapping is keyed on the wrong thing.**
Keying by state name cannot work, because the same name means different things under different
roles. A table keyed by `(role, state)` would be correct and is a much larger object — and it is
knowledge that belongs to the web platform rather than to React, which is an argument for the third
artifact this report has already proposed.

**Dead schema is a distinct failure mode from a missing field, and harder to see.** `axes` and
`whenAxis` validated, were documented, and appeared in the roster of what a contract may contain —
for months, doing nothing. A missing field announces itself the moment you reach for it. A field that
accepts your input and discards it does not, and a contract author would have had no way to tell.
Nothing in the repo could have caught it: the schema was satisfied, the gates were green, and only
generating a component that needed it exposed the gap.

**The count of untested schema surface is now the interesting number.** `roleByAxis` and
`internalOnly` have still never been used by any contract, and `minHitArea` and `contrast` are read
by nothing. Some of those are deliberately unenforceable; some may be dead in the same way `axes`
was.

**A valued state looks like the same shape as an axis, and is deliberately not merged with one.**
Both are "one of these values". An axis is a styling choice the consumer makes; a state is a
condition the component is in, which the platform may own or which may be derived. `Checkbox`'s
`checked` is `shared` and partly derived; `Button`'s `variant` is neither. Merging them would make
`control` meaningless for half the merged concept.

**The emitter is accumulating platform knowledge that belongs somewhere else.** It now holds: which
ARIA attribute a state name maps to, which of those are meaningful when false, and which contract
value names map onto which ARIA value names. None of it is React-specific — all of it is _web_
knowledge — and it lives in a React emitter because there is nowhere else. That is now three
separate tables arguing for the web-platform artifact this report proposed after the first pass.

**There now appear to be at least three kinds of behaviour, not one.** Activation (a click that
toggles), navigation (moving between items), and stepping (moving a number). `activates` covers the
first; the second and third have nothing. A single "behaviour vocabulary" was the working assumption
and it looks too coarse — `RadioGroup` and `Slider` both need "the arrow keys do something" and need
entirely different somethings.

**`Slider` suggests `layout` should not be attempted as declarations at all.** The accordion's width
defect wanted a constraint; the slider's fill wants arithmetic. A block trying to hold both, plus
static positioning, is three unrelated things wearing one name. It may be that position-from-a-value
is simply the consumer's job, and the contract's role is only to say the relationship exists.

**The platform-knowledge tables in the emitter are now the largest undesigned artifact in the
system.** Which ARIA attribute a state maps to; which are meaningful when false; which contract
value names map to which ARIA value names; which elements have a native `disabled`; which are
natively focusable; which have an implicit role; which edit their own value. Seven tables, none
React-specific, all in a React emitter. A second backend would need every one and would get at least
one subtly wrong.

**The same bug keeps recurring in different code paths, and that is the strongest signal here.** A
state that reaches no ARIA attribute has now happened three times: the radio's `aria-checked`, the
tooltip's wrongly-applied `aria-expanded`, and the tab's `aria-selected`. Each was a different branch
of the same closed table. A table that must be consulted from four places and has no default is not a
table problem — it is an argument that the mapping does not belong in the emitter at all.

**Cross-boundary references look like the last structural gap in the composition model.** Within a
component, `namedBy` and `controls` work. Across one — a tab to its panel, a field to a control
passed into it — there is nothing. Both cases are common, both produce silently unnamed regions, and
a collection already establishes that components know about each other.

**Regeneration safety is currently a convention, not a mechanism.** The emitter skips
`theme.css` when it exists, which is the right behaviour and is enforced by one `existsSync`. Nothing
marks the generated files as generated in a way a tool could check, and nothing would stop a
consumer's edit to `Switch.tsx` being silently overwritten.

**The read-only state is a live example of a contract promising something no one can see.** It
declares `visual: "NOT DECIDED"`, and the rendered switch confirms it: read-only looks identical to
interactive. The honesty worked — nothing was invented — but the component ships a state a user
cannot perceive.

## Problems found

**1. The contract cannot say how a state reaches the DOM, and that is a portability problem.**
A consumer styling `[aria-checked='true']` against a React build would find a Vue build using
`data-state="checked"`, with both backends conformant. The binding notes say what React chose, in
prose that no tool reads.

**2. Structural CSS is invented by the emitter, per component.**
The contract's promise — _the thumb's position carries the state for anyone who cannot rely on
colour_ — is implemented by three lines the emitter hardcoded. No contract states them, no gate
checks them, and a second backend would rewrite them from scratch.

**3. Positioning leaked into the consumer's file.**
`inset-inline-start` on the thumb is structure, and it ended up in `theme.css` because the emitter did
not know it was needed. A consumer who deletes their theme file gets a broken component rather than an
unstyled one, which is not the promise.

**4. There is no component-level styling handle in the convention.**
The emitter invented `data-juro-component`. It works, and it is undocumented, unversioned and unowned.

**5. Nothing marks generated files as generated, mechanically.**
`Switch.tsx` and `Switch.structure.css` carry a comment. `prop-map.md` solves the same problem with a
byte-equality check; nothing equivalent protects emitted components, and the regeneration check that
ADR 0002 anticipated is still unwritten.

**5b. And that regeneration check cannot be byte-equality, which is what ADR 0002 assumed.**
Prettier owns formatting in this repo and reflows the emitter's output, so `emit → format` and
`format → emit` disagree forever. A byte-comparing gate would fail on every run and be switched off
within a week — the exact failure the repo's own rule about day-one gates warns about. This is not a
new problem here: `adr-index.mjs` compares _parsed rows_ rather than bytes for the same reason, and
says so in its header.

**5d. A component that declares no cause for its state compiles to something inert, and no gate says so.**
`Switch` lost its click for exactly this reason. The emitter knows — it writes a comment about it —
but a comment in generated output is not enforcement. This is the shape of defect the whole
regeneration-check idea does not catch: the output was correct with respect to its input, and the
input was incomplete.

**5e. Which ARIA attributes are meaningful when false is emitter knowledge.**
`aria-checked` must render `false`; `aria-readonly` may be omitted. The contract says only that a
state exists. Both backends and both authors have to know this table, and it lives in neither
schema.

**5c. `pnpm verify` does not typecheck emitted components.**
`typecheck` runs against `packages/react/tsconfig.json`, whose `include` is `src`. The sandbox has no
tsconfig at all. The three dead-setter errors above were found by invoking `tsc` by hand; nothing in
`pnpm verify` or CI would have caught them, and nothing would catch an emitter that starts producing
uncompilable code.

**6b. A component can resize as its state changes, and no contract can forbid it.**
The accordion changed width on every open and close. The promise that would prevent it — the size
must not depend on which parts are visible — is a constraint on layout, and there is no layout block
to hold it, constraint-shaped or otherwise.

**6c. `paints` accepts structural channels.**
`Accordion`'s contract declares `display` and `gap` as paint channels. Neither carries design
intent in the sense `paints` documents; both are structure. Nothing distinguishes them, so the
paint/theme split a consumer relies on is enforced only by the care of whoever wrote the contract.

**20. ARIA references cannot cross a component boundary.**
A tab cannot point at its panel; a panel cannot be named by its tab. `controls` and `namedBy` name a
sibling part only. The generated panel is announced unnamed, and the generated tab references
nothing.

**21. `visibleWhen` on a root was ignored.**
Only child parts were checked, so a panel that hides itself and a dialog that appears both rendered
permanently visible.

**18. A free-form value was mirrored into the DOM as a data attribute.**
Whatever a person typed appeared in `data-juro-state-value`, visible in devtools and in any serialised
markup. The emitter treated every state as a styling hook; free text is content. Fixed, and nothing
would have caught it.

**19. Slider's core behaviour is not merely missing — parts of it are not expressible as any kind of
static declaration.** The fill's length is the value as a percentage: arithmetic over a state. No
`layout` block, constraint-shaped or otherwise, would hold it.

**17. Template-generated expressions can be syntactically valid and semantically inverted.**
`hidden={!checkedValue === 'checked'}` typechecked, rendered, and silently never showed the mark.
No gate catches an expression no human wrote; TypeScript accepted it because the comparison is
legal, just useless.

**15. `axes` and `whenAxis` were dead schema.**
Declared, validated, documented, and read by nothing. A contract could specify a complete variant
surface and generate a component with no variants. Now fixed, and the class of defect is the
finding: a field that silently discards valid input cannot be detected by any gate here.

**16. The axis attribute family is undocumented.**
`data-<prefix>-<axis>` joins `part` and `state` as a styling handle a consumer will rely on. The
emitter invented it; no schema, README or ADR mentions it.

**11. A generated RadioGroup contradicts its own contract's stated behaviour.**
Arrow keys do nothing; every option is in the Tab order. `intent.behaviour` describes the opposite,
in prose, and the APG requires it normatively. This is the first component where the contract's
prose and its generated output actively disagree.

**12. The state-to-DOM mapping is keyed by state name and cannot be.**
`open` is `aria-expanded` on an accordion trigger and nothing at all on a tooltip wrapper. The
emitter now gates ARIA attributes on the element having a role, which suppresses the wrong output
without producing the right one.

**13. A member's reflected state did not reach the DOM at all.**
Because it is `internal` it produces no prop, and the attribute loop walked props. Every radio
rendered `role="radio"` with no `aria-checked`.

**14. `semantics.focusable` was declared and read by nothing.**
Two contracts set it. Radio items were unreachable by keyboard until the emitter started reading it.

**7. `Field` compiles to something that looks right and does nothing.**
Every part renders; no relationship is wired. The control is named by its placeholder, the error is
not announced, `aria-invalid` is absent. The relationships are stated only as prose in
`intent.behaviour`, so the emitter cannot see them — and a reviewer looking at the rendered result
cannot see their absence.

**8. `semantics.role` is assumed to belong to the root, and sometimes does not.**
`AccordionItem`'s role belongs to its `trigger`. The emitter put it on the root, making the entire
section — heading and panel — announce as a single button. The binding states the correct target in
a prose note because neither schema has a field for it.

**9. A slot with no matching anatomy part has nowhere to go.**
`Field`'s `control` slot rendered after the parts, placing the input below its own error message.
Nothing declares which part a slot fills, and nothing declares the order parts render in.

**10. `Accordion` cannot be compiled from its contract at all.**
Its central fact — which sections are open — is described in `intent.behaviour` prose and appears in
no machine-readable field. It is not a state, not an axis, not a slot. The generated component is
correct and inert, and no emitter improvement can fix that: the information is not there.

**6. The generated Switch cannot participate in a form.**
It renders a `<button role="switch">` with no form control behind it. The contract has no way to
express form participation, so the emitter correctly did not fake it — but the component is
consequently unusable in a plain HTML form, which a consumer will discover at integration time.

## Open questions

1. **Where does the state-to-DOM mapping live?** It is not agnostic — `aria-checked` is a web idea —
   so it does not belong in the contract. But leaving it to each backend guarantees divergence. A
   third artifact, owned by the contracts package and describing the _web platform_ rather than any
   framework, is one possible answer; a required section in each binding is another.

2. **What is in the `layout` block, and who writes it?** Enough to place a thumb out of flow, a
   popover against an anchor, a panel that animates from zero height. The risk is obvious: a layout
   vocabulary rich enough to be useful is CSS with extra steps, which is the failure the behaviour
   vocabulary is designed to avoid. Does it name a small set of named layout primitives, the way the
   behaviour vocabulary names interaction primitives?

3. **Should `data-<prefix>-component` be part of the anatomy convention?** If part attributes are the
   library's stable styling surface, they need scoping, and scoping is currently invented per backend.

4. **How does regeneration prove it has not destroyed consumer work, given that byte-equality is
   ruled out?** Three candidates, none obviously right: the emitter runs Prettier on its own output
   before writing, so emitted and formatted are the same thing; the check formats both sides before
   comparing; or the comparison is structural rather than textual, the way `adr-index` compares
   parsed rows. The first is the smallest and makes the emitter depend on the repo's formatter
   config, which a consumer running it in their own repo will not share.

5. **What is the shape of the navigation primitive?** `RadioGroup` needs roughly: move linearly on
   the arrow keys, wrap, skip disabled, select as you move, keep one Tab stop on the selected item.
   Those look like five named parameters on the `collection.selection` block rather than a state
   machine — but tabs, listboxes, menus and toolbars each vary one or two of them, and it is not yet
   clear whether the same five cover all of them or whether each pattern adds another.

6. **Does positioning belong in a contract at all?** Declaring intent (`placement: top`) leaves a
   tooltip that cannot flip and is clipped by any scrolling ancestor. Declaring the mechanism turns
   the contract into a layout engine's configuration. A third option — naming a positioning
   _strategy_ the way behaviour names a primitive — has not been tried.

7. **Where do relationships between parts live?** `Field` needs _this control is named by that
   label, described by that description, and invalidated by that error_. It is not styling, not a
   state and not a slot. An `associations` block on the contract is one answer; making it the
   behaviour vocabulary's job is another, since ARIA relationships are arguably interaction wiring.

8. **Does a role belong to a part rather than a component?** And is that a contract fact or a
   binding one? The evidence says contract — which region carries the meaning is not a framework
   question — but that makes `semantics` a per-part concern rather than a top-level one.

9. **Should a slot name a part?** Something like `"control": { "part": "control" }`, with the schema
   requiring the named part to exist. That reconciles the two vocabularies and gives orphaned slots
   nowhere to hide.

10. **Is `internal` too coarse?** It behaved correctly here, where both `internal` states are
    platform-observed. It has not been tested against an ancestor-owned state, which is the case ADR
    0004 flagged as the reason three values might be too few.

11. **What does form participation look like, given the button-not-checkbox choice?** The binding chose
    a button for styleability and lost form submission. A hidden input alongside is the usual answer
    and is a decision no contract currently records.
