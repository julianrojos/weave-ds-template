# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Each ADR captures one architecturally significant decision: its context, the decision, and its
consequences. ADRs are immutable once **Accepted** — to change a decision, supersede it with a new
ADR rather than editing the old one.

**An ADR records the decision and stays agnostic; it does not restate the specifics that realize
it.** Those specifics — schemas, scripts, generated files, code snippets, or reference docs — are
the decision's **contracts**, and they live with the code they govern. An ADR _links_ its
contracts in a `## Contract` table; it does not inline them. The shape is in
[`0000-template.md`](./0000-template.md). This is deliberate: contracts evolve with the
implementation, so keeping them out of the record is what lets an Accepted ADR stay stable instead
of being rewritten every time the details move.

**Statuses:** `Draft` → `Proposed` → `Accepted` → (`Superseded by NNNN` | `Deprecated`)

**Pre-v0 status policy.** Until the first release there is nothing downstream to protect, so the
immutability rule above is not yet in force — ADRs are edited in place and most stay **Draft**,
because decisions can still move. Only foundational decisions **already mechanized in code** are
**Accepted**. At v0 the Accepted-is-immutable / supersede-don't-edit discipline switches on for
good.

That bar is worth stating plainly, because it is the one that keeps this folder honest: _a
decision nobody has implemented is a Draft, however confident it sounds._

## The records

**This directory starts almost empty in the template**, like `docs/research/`,
`.ai/maps/proposals/` and `packages/contracts/components/`. You get the machinery, not somebody
else's conclusions; records added after source work are decisions for this repo, not inherited
template conclusions.

That is worth being explicit about, because an ADR folder is exactly where inherited decisions do
the most damage. A record you did not make, about a system you have not built yet, still reads as
binding — and the first thing it binds is the reasoning you were about to do yourself. A template's
own construction decisions are not architecture decisions for the system built with it.

The one record that ships with the untouched template is the exception that proves it:
**0001 describes how this repository is organised**, which is a property of the template itself and
therefore genuinely inherited when you adopt it. Anything the template settled _mechanically_ is
documented next to the code that enforces it, not here:

## Adding an ADR

1. Copy [`0000-template.md`](./0000-template.md); number it sequentially (`NNNN-kebab-title.md`).
2. Start at **Draft**; promote as the decision firms up and lands in code. The status lives in the
   record and nowhere else.
3. Run **`pnpm adr-index`**, and commit the regenerated table. Never edit it by hand.

`pnpm adr-index:check` fails the build if you skip step 3 — an ADR that is not in the index does not
exist, because nobody browses a directory listing.

The `ds-decide` skill does all three, and will refuse to bundle two separable decisions into one
record.

## What belongs here, and what does not

|                                                        | Goes in          | Why                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "We will namespace every custom property"              | `docs/ADR/`      | A decision. Changing it later has consequences worth tracing.           |
| "The Figma file has 41 variables across 3 collections" | `docs/research/` | A measurement. It has no consequences; it is evidence _for_ a decision. |
| The JSON Schema that enforces the decision             | next to the code | A contract. It moves with the implementation.                           |

`docs/research/` is the **pre-decision** space and `docs/ADR/` is the **post-decision** space. A
research document ends in open questions; an ADR answers one of them.

## Writing one that is worth reading

- **One decision per record.** If the draft contains two "we will" sentences that could be argued
  separately, it is two ADRs.
- **Context is evidence, not narrative.** Prefer a measured number to an adjective. "The manifest
  is 1.79 MB, so reading it to answer a question about one component is not viable in a context
  window" is context; "the manifest is quite large" is not.
- **Consequences must include real negatives.** An ADR with only positives was not a decision, it
  was an announcement. Name what this costs, what it forecloses, and what will go wrong quietly.
- **Alternatives considered** are only worth writing where someone would genuinely have chosen
  differently. Do not pad.
