 * Deriving it from the contract would only ever restate the contract's own claims, which is the one
 * thing a harness must not do.
 *
 * `works` does NOT mean finished. It means: everything this component's contract states, it does.
 * Every component here still gets its layout from the consumer's theme file, because the contract
 * has no way to say where a part sits — see `crossCutting` below, which applies to all fifteen.
