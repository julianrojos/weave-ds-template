The disabled tab stays focusable and refuses to be chosen, which is why it carries aria-disabled rather than the native attribute — a disabled button cannot be focused at all.

The contract states all four and can declare none of them; they follow from an element name. The costs are real and visible: the theme file opens with a reset cancelling the browser&rsquo;s own border, padding and colours, and the open state has to be synced back from the element&rsquo;s attribute with a MutationObserver because the close event never fired.
